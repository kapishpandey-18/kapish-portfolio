# CleanMyCar – Daily Car Cleaning Subscription Platform

## Overview

CleanMyCar is a society-based car cleaning subscription platform designed for gated complexes and residential communities. It enables car owners to subscribe to daily cleaning services and allows cleaning partners to manage daily jobs, attendance, proof-of-work, payments, and customer feedback through a single digital ecosystem.

## Goal

To create a transparent and reliable subscription platform for both car owners and car cleaners by:

- Digitizing daily cleaning tracking
- Automating subscription payments
- Providing proof of service with images
- Offering cleaner payouts and performance tracking
- Making customer feedback measurable
